## 🌟 Overview

Campus Connect addresses the common problem of students missing campus events due to fragmented information across emails, social media, posters, and group chats. Our platform provides:

- **Centralized Event Discovery**: All campus events in one organized location
- **Student Verification**: Secure, university-email verified access
- **Easy Event Management**: Simple event creation and registration process
- **Category-Based Browsing**: Filter events by type (Sports, Academic, Social, etc.)
- **Free Event Registration**: Cart system for quick event sign-ups

Inspired by the success of Classmate (a student discount platform in Qatar), Campus Connect applies the same community-focused approach to campus event management.
